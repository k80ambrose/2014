<p>one time this guy asked me<br>
what's the first year you remember? <br> 
and i was like there's<br>
a flourescent ball of blue light that predates memory <br>
it radiates and permeates and hesitates <br>
from center consule it operates<br>
surveilling everything i do<br>
do you also suffer from this thing?<br>
yeah he said<br>
i do he said<br>
i know the glowing green orb in my head he said<br>
so then i was like<br>
can i ask you a favor? <br>
he said sure<br>
i need you to take my life<br>
and dye it mint green<br>
like Bethany Mota’s blood<br>
overly saccharine and soft<br>
cloying like cotton candy<br>

I roam around that store for decades<br>
unscrewing bottles and sniffing their contents<br>
