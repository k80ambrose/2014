  <h1>twenty fourteen</h1>  <div></div>
<p>one time this guy asked me<br>
what's the first year you remember? <br> 
and i was like there's<br>
a flourescent ball of blue light that predates memory <br>
it radiates and permeates and hesitates <br>
from center consule it operates<br>
surveilling everything i do<br>
do you also know this thing? i asked<br>
yeah he said<br>
i do he said<br>
i know the glowing green orb in my head he said<br>
so then i was like<br>
can i ask you a favor? <br>
he said sure<br>
i need you to take my life<br>
and dye it mint green<br>
like Bethany Mota’s blood<br>
overly saccharine and soft<br>
cloying like cotton candy<br>
hey guys! <br>
welcome back to my channel<br>
today we’re going to be doing something a l i t t le diff e re n t<br>
her voice fades into ukulele stock music<br>
does it stick to your hands or get caught in the riptide?<br>
fly me to the brilliant Azure Sky<br>
where two clouds hover<br>
indefinitely<br>
i never actually read The Fault In Our Stars to completion<br>
but the cover art alone<br>
launched me into a terminal dream of An<br>
sel Elgort<br>
nsterdam and prepubescent<br>
gnst<br>
okay?<br>
okay.<br>
I've been a bad girl<br>
why don't you wash my mouth out<br>
with Bath and Body Works soap<br>
Here, if you buy three <br>
and <br>
I buy three <br>
we can use the<br>
buy three <br>
get three <br>
free <br>
deal <br>
I roam around that store for decades<br>
unscrewing bottles and sniffing their contents<br>
it was like a mueseam for the nose<br>
are you ready to check out?<br>
I'd never be ready<br>
I could spend eternity in that store<br>
oh wow<br>
oh no<br>
oh fuck<br>
its really bad isn't it?<br>
yeah...<br>

what was the fault in our stars?<br>
since when was celebrity uncool?

the twittersphere<br>
is also blue<br>
		
listerine<br>
mouth wash<br>

that this thing isn't going anywhere?

pistachio ice cream<br>

do you remember when things went viral,<br>
before things went viral?<br>
when everyone knew about it
do you remeber when every youtuber was still on vine?<br>
	
tumblr,<br>
have you heard of it?<br>
			oh, you haven’t?<br>

	blog page<br>

<br><br>
			didn’t you hear Malala’s speech??<br>
skate in
skirts<br>
you know its scary to think he said<br>
that we're the last ones who remember a time before the big blue ball enveloped everything<br>
but we don't, i said, it came before us, it predates memory<br>
but at least we know its exists and <br>
at one point there was a reality outside it<br>
cranium
asphyxiate me<br>
with a rainbow choker necklace<br>
trample me<br>
with white converse<br>
when every youtuber<br>
was<br>
still<br>
on vine<br>
D.I.Y. this and<br>
that<br>
the big blue ball in our brains<br>
even if you unraveled every infinity scarf<br>
they still couldn’t span the distance<br>
betw e e n now and t h e n<br>
the aquamarine queen's rain is over<br>
when will you get over it?<br>
when will you move on?<br>
when will you grow up?<br>
i want to dye<br>
it mint green <br>
I want existance<br>
to feel<br>
so goddamn<br>
ce rul ean<br>
your eyes burn when you look at me<br>
seafoam <br>
froths forth from <br>
your lips<br>
with delight<br>
and all i know is <br>
teal            ocean 	sky <br>
gapes open<br>
fall through<br>
fall through<br>
fall through<br>
