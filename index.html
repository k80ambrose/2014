  <h1>twenty fourteen</h1> 
<p>one time this guy asked me<br>
what's the first year you remember?<br> 
and i was like there's<br>
a flourescent ball of blue light that predates memory<br>
it radiates and permeates and hesitates<br>
from center consule it operates<br>
surveilling all i do<br>
do you know her?<br>
yeah he said<br>
i do he said<br>
i know the glowing green orb inside my skull he said<br>
so then i was like<br>
can i ask you a favor? <br>
and he said sure<br>
i need you to take my life<br>
and dye it mint green<br>
like Bethany Mota’s blood<br>
overly saccharine and soft<br>
cloying like cotton candy<br>
hey guys! <br>
welcome back to my channel<br>
today we’re going to be doing something a l i t t le diff e re n t<br>
her voice fades into ukulele stock music<br>
does it stick to your hands or get caught in the riptide?<br>
lately i've been lonely<br>
but aparently everyone else is lonely too so<br>
that makes it fine?<br>
fly me to the brilliant Azure Sky<br>
where two clouds hover<br>
indefinitely<br>
i never actually read The Fault In Our Stars to completion<br>
but the cover art alone<br>
launched me into a terminal dream of An<br>
sel Elgort<br>
nsterdam and prepubescent<br>
gnst<br>
okay?<br>
okay.<br>
what ever happened to john green?<br>
what ever happened to mint green?<br>
it was never just a color<br>
it smybolized squeeky clean<br>
Tiffany<br>
Quaranteen<br>
I've been a bad girl<br>
why don't you wash my mouth out<br>
with Bath and Body Works soap<br>
Here, if you buy three <br>
and I buy three <br>
we can use the<br>
BUY THREE <br>
GET THREE <br>
free <br>
deal <br>
I roam around that store for decades<br>
pacing, unscrewing bottles, and sniffing their contents<br>
I had to find the three products <br>
and i wouldnt know which three were my favorite until i had sniffed<br>
every bottle in the store<br>

are you ready to check out?<br>
I'd never be ready<br>
I could spend eternity in that store<br>
oh wow<br>
oh no<br>
oh fuck<br>
its really bad isn't it?<br>
yeah...<br>

	
i'll try my very best
i'll try my very best
i'll try my very best
		
the listerine scene <br>
squeeky clean
quarantine

that this thing isn't going anywhere?

do you remember when things went viral<br>
before things were viral?<br>
when everyone knew about whatever thing it was<br>
do you remember when every youtuber was still on vine?<br>
are you on tumblr?<br>
start designing your blog<br>
and accidentally<br>
(learn<br>
to <br>
code)<br>
YOU<br>
yes, you!!! <br>
You need <br>
to learn to code! 1 !	1 !<br>
	go to code.org to participate in this year’s<br>
	hour 		of 		code<br>
Haven’t you heard that women in STEM are the future?
That’s the thing now.<br>
That's whats going to save us<br>
girls online<br>
didn’t you hear Malala’s speech??<br>
skate in
skirts<br>
	
you know its scary to think he said<br>
that we're the youngest who remember a time before the big blue ball enveloped everything<br>
but we don't remember, i said<br>
yeah but we know its exists and we know<br>
at one point there was a reality outside it<br>
the ones who came after us exist within it<br>
like its ingrained in their infant craniums<br>
for us it was more voluntary descent<br>
or i don't know about voluntary, we had more agency in the matter<br>
of setting boundries in our relationship to technology given that<br>
we saw with our own eyes the proliferation of smartphones<br>
and tablets, the rise of instagram and snapchat, technology being<br>
used in the classroom, like do you remembr when smart boards?
we saw it happen 
they didn't
they got here
and it already was this way
does that make us responsible?<br>
responsible for what?<br>
for telling them about the big blue ball?<br>
whenever i think about bath and body works<br>
i think about a bottle of cherry blossom lotion<br>
that's been on a dresser in an attic in kingston new york<br>
for upwards of 50 years<br>
asphyxiate me<br>
with rainbow choker necklaces<br>
when i gasp for air<br>
put those pods in your ears<br>
to drown out my begging<br>
with hyperpop<br>
hello?<br>
helooooo???<br>
	
trample me<br>
with white converse<br>
	
the big blue ball in our brains<br>
it's just so<br>
beautiful and bright<br>
inflated with infinite possibilities<br>
i want to touch it<br>

tears well when i look at it<br>
its just so bright<br>
and light<br>
and #FFFFervescent<br>
	
so, to answer your original question<br>
the first year I remember is mint green twenty fourteen<br>

even if you unraveled every infinity scarf<br>
their yarn couldn’t span the cognitive distance<br>
between now and then<br>
when white converse turn red<br>
the aquamarine queen is dead<br>
her rain is over<br>
stop saying<br>
i want to dye<br>
it mint green <br>
i want to be<br>
so goddamn<br>
ce rul ean<br>
it burns if you stare too long<br>
seafoam froths forth from <br>
lips with delight<br>
when the sky gapes open<br>
