  <h1>twenty fourteen</h1>  <div></div>
<p>one time this guy asked me<br>
what's the first year you remember? <br> 
and i was like there's<br>
a flourescent ball of blue light that predates memory <br>
it radiates and permeates and hesitates <br>
from center consule it operates<br>
surveilling everything i do<br>
do you also have this thing? i asked<br>
yeah he said<br>
i do he said<br>
i know the glowing green orb in my head he said<br>
so then i was like<br>
can i ask you a favor? <br>
he said sure<br>
i need you to take my life<br>
and dye it mint green<br>
like Bethany Mota’s blood<br>
overly saccharine and soft<br>
cloying like cotton candy<br>
hey guys! <br>
welcome back to my channel<br>
today we’re going to be doing something a l i t t le diff e re n t<br>
her voice fades into ukulele stock music<br>
does it stick to your hands or get caught in the riptide?<br>
fly me to the brilliant Azure Sky<br>
where two clouds hover<br>
indefinitely<br>
i never actually read The Fault In Our Stars to completion<br>
but the cover art alone<br>
launched me into a terminal dream of An<br>
sel Elgort<br>
nsterdam and prepubescent<br>
gnst<br>
okay?<br>
okay.<br>
what ever happened to john green?<br>
what ever happened to mint green?<br>
it was never just a color<br>
it signified something<br>
squeeky clean<br>
quaranteen<br>
I've been a bad girl<br>
why don't you wash my mouth out<br>
with Bath and Body Works soap<br>
Here, if you buy three <br>
and I buy three <br>
we can use the<br>
buy three <br>
get three <br>
free <br>
deal <br>
I roam around that store for decades<br>
frantically pacing, unscrewing bottles, and sniffing their contents<br>
it was like a mueseam for the nose<br>
are you ready to check out?<br>
I'd never be ready<br>
I could spend eternity in that store<br>
oh wow<br>
oh no<br>
oh fuck<br>
its really bad isn't it?<br>
yeah...<br>

what was the fault in our stars?<br>
since when was celebrity uncool?
	
i'll try my very best
i'll try my very best
i'll try my very best
the twittersphere<br>
is also blue<br>
		
the listerine scene <br>
squeeky clean
quarantine

that this thing isn't going anywhere?

do you remember when things went viral,<br>
before things were viral?<br>
when everyone knew about whatever thing it was<br>
do you remember when every youtuber was still on vine?<br>
have you heard of tumblr?
start designing your blog
and accidentally<br>
(learn<br>
to <br>
code)<br>
YOU<br>
yes, you!!! <br>
You need <br>
to learn to code! 1 !	1 !<br>
	go to code.org to participate in this year’s<br>
	hour 		of 		code<br>
Haven’t you heard that women in STEM are the future?
That’s the thing now.<br>
That's whats going to save us<br>
girls online<br>
didn’t you hear Malala’s speech??<br>
skate in
skirts<br>
	
you know its scary to think he said<br>
that we're the youngest ones who remember a time before the big blue ball enveloped everything<br>
but we don't remember, i said, it came before us<br>
yeah but we know its exists and <br>
at one point there was a reality outside it<br>
the ones who came after us exist within the blue ball<br>
in our cranium since birth
does that make us responsible?
responsible for what?
for telling them about the big blue ball?
	
jiggle physics	
asphyxiate me<br>
with rainbow choker necklaces<br>
when i gasp for air<br>
put those pods in your ears<br>
to drown out my begging<br>
in hyperpobcast<br>
hello?
helooooo???<br>
trample me<br>
with white converse<br>
	
the big blue ball in our brains<br>
is so beautiful and bright<br>
tears well when i look at it<br>
its just so bright<br>
and light<br>
and #FFFFervescent<br>
	
even if you unraveled every infinity scarf<br>
their yarn couldn’t span the distance<br>
between now and then<br>
the tranformation was imperceptible<br>
I didn't know what hope was until it disapeered
when white converse turn red<br>
the aquamarine queen is dead<br>
her rain is over<br>
when will you get over it?<br>
when will you move on?<br>
when will you grow up?<br>
stop saying<br>
i want to dye<br>
it mint green <br>
i want to be<br>
so goddamn<br>
ce rul ean<br>
it burns if you stare too long<br>
seafoam froths forth from <br>
your lips with delight<br>
when the sky gapes open<br>
fall through<br>
fall through<br>
fall through<br>
	fall through<br>
fall through<br>
fall through<br>
	fall through<br>
fall through<br>
fall through<br>
	fall through<br>
fall through<br>
fall through<br>
	fall through<br>
fall through<br>
fall through<br>
	fall through<br>
fall through<br>
