  		<h1>twenty fourteen</h1>
		<p>
			one time this guy asked me<br>
			what's the first year you remember?<br>
			and i was like there's<br>
			a flourescent ball of blue light that predates memory<br>
			it radiates and permeates and hesitates<br>
			from center consule it operates<br>
			surveilling all i do<br>
			do you know her?<br>
			yeah he said<br>
			i do he said<br>
			i know the glowing green orb inside my skull he said<br>
			so then i was like<br>
			can i ask you a favor? and<br>
			he said sure<br>
			i need you to take my life<br>
			and dye it mint green<br>
			like bethany mota's blood<br>
			overly saccharine and soft<br>
			cloying like cotton candy<br>
			hey guys! <br>
			welcome back to my channel<br>
			today we’re going to be doing something a l i t t l e diff e re n t<br>
			her voice fades in to ukulele stock music<br>
			does it stick to your hands or get caught in the riptide?<br>
			lately i've been lonely<br>
			but aparently everyone else is too so<br>
			that makes it fine <br>
			i guessed<br>
			that by now <br>
			we would have <br>
			figured more of<br>
			this stuff out<br>
			but we really haven't<br>
			it seems to have only<br>
			gotten worse<br>
			messier<br>
			the problem, more abstract<br>
			fly me to the brilliant Azure Sky<br>
			where two clouds hover<br>
			indefinitely<br>
			i never actually read <br>
			The Fault In Our Stars to completion<br>
			but the cover art alone<br>
			launched me into a terminal dream of An<br>
			sel Elgort<br>
			nsterdam and prepubescent<br>
			gnst<br>
			okay?<br>
			okay.<br>
			what ever happened to john green?<br>
			what ever happened to mint green?<br>
			it wasn't just a color<br>
			it smybolized something else<br>
			entirely <br>
			abstract<br>
			new and artificial<br>
			some mint green<br>
			squeeky clean<br>
			Tiffany blue<br>
			ideal without a clue<br>
			of what it might do<br>
			to us<br>
			it's like one day they just decided to manufacture every product<br>
			in this one color<br>
			of course it existed before<br>
			suddenly it was ubiquitous<br>
			I've been a bad girl<br>
			so naughty for you<br>
			tube my esophagus is your tube<br>
			stick ur fingers down<br>
			and wash my mouth out<br>
			with Bath & Body Works hand soap<br>
			Here,<br>
			if you buy three <br>
			and i buy three <br>
			we can use the<br>
			BUY THREE <br>
			GET THREE <br>
			FREE deal<br>
			i stare back in blank giddy<br>
			she turns and vanishes into the store<br>
			i reach for a basket<br>
			we had 20 dollars and hundreds of options<br>
			a sensory exploration<br>
			an uncharted landscape<br>
			mall rat manifest destiny<br>
			the old B&BW store felt bigger<br>
			since i would roam around there for decades<br>
			pacing, unscrewing bottles, and sniffing their contents<br>
			I had to find the three products <br>
			and i wouldnt know which three were my favorite until i had sniffed<br>
			every<br>
			single<br>
			bottle<br>
			in the store<br>
			are you ready to check out?<br>
			there were still 30 permutations i haven't tried<br>
			i'd never be ready to check out<br>
			because there would always be 30 more permutations I haven't tried<br>
			imagine being a getty image<br>
			imagine being a 90s kid<br>
			its really bad isn't it?<br>
			yeah...<br>
			listen, babe,<br>
			things have gotten a lot worse<br>
			here on the listerine scene <br>
			quarantine<br>
			shut up and chew ur<br>
			eos lipbalm<br>
			ebola<br>
			happened in 2014,<br>
			right?<br>
			do you remember when things went viral<br>
			before things were viral?<br>
			when everyone knew about whatever thing it was that week?<br>
			now there's too much to know<br>
			too much to keep up with<br>
			too much noise<br>
			the cycle churns rapidly<br>
			inside these little bubbles<br>
			if a bath bomb explodes <br>
			off camera<br>
			did it even happen?<br>
			do trees in empty forests<br>
			fall on deaf ears?<br>
			numbers don't impress me<br>
			views don't impress me<br>
			exposure won't impress me<br>
			do you remember when every youtuber was still on vine?<br>
			when ariana grande licked that donut and it caused a big stir<br>
			do you remember when sexy and cute collapsed?<br>
			into one face<br>
			This is Why I Left Buzzfeed<br>
			aren't you on tumblr?<br>
			start designing your blog<br>
			you'll learn to code by accident!<br>
			YOU<br>
			yes, you!!! <br>
			You need <br>
			to learn to code! 1 !	1 !<br>
			go to code.org to participate in this year’s<br>
			hour 		of 		code<br>
			haven't you heard that Women in STEM are<br>
			The Future?<br>
			That’s the thing now<br>
			That's whats going to save us<br>
			girls online<br>
			don’t you remember Malalala’s speech?<br>
			don't you remember when things went flat?<br>
			when everyone got the blues?<br>
			you know its scary to think he said<br>
			that we're the youngest people who remember <br>
			a time before <br>
			the Big Blue Ball enveloped everything<br>
			but we don't remember! i said that's my whole point!<br>
			yeah, but we know the ball exists and we know<br>
			that at one point there was a reality outside of it<br>
			he said<br>
			the ones who came after us exist entirely within it<br>
			soft and diffused glow<br>
			for us it was more of a voluntary descent<br>
			or i don't know about it <br>
			being voluntary, but we certainly had <br>
			more agency in the matter<br>
			of setting boundries in our relationships with technology <br>
			given that<br>
			we saw with our own eyes,<br>
			the proliferation of smartphones<br>
			and tablets and like the rise of social media that<br>
			happened in middle school for us <br>
			it happened when we were sentient<br>
			they didn't see it happen<br>
			they just got here<br>
			and it already was this way<br>
			they are the ipad babies and they're gonna grow up<br>
			Does that make sense?<br>
			Does that make us responsible?<br>
			responsible for what? i asked<br>
			for telling them about the big blue ball insisde their bains?<br>
			whenever i think about bath and body works<br>
			i think about a bottle of lotion<br>
			that has sat on a dresser <br>
			in my grandfather's attic <br>
			for three decades<br>
			it's the flagship scent:<br>
			japanese cherry blossom <br>
			the memory is the scent<br>
			was the rot<br>
			yeah we're definetely responsible<br>
			i mean like<br>
			who else is gonna do it?<br>
			i don't think our parents get it or like,<br>
			they wouldn't be able to communicate it in a way that's effective<br>
			what do we even say?<br>
			what is there to say?<br>
			hey kids there's this big blue ball in your brains<br>
			i don't think they'd believe us<br>
			i think they think we're crazy<br>
			asphyxiate me<br>
			with rainbow chokers made of lace<br>
			inhale<br>
			the sweet rot<br>
			so elegantely<br>
			like a fine wine<br>
			or kimchi or like a moldy piece of wonderbread<br>
			or something<br>
			the lotion in the attic will be the last thing i remember<br>
			trample me<br>
			with white converse<br>
			the big blue ball inside our brains<br>
			it's just so<br>
			big beautiful and bright<br>
			inflated with infinite possibilities<br>
			i want to touch it<br>
			i want to squeeze it<br>
			i reach out<br>
			so desperately
			i try to pop it<br>
			but it burns<br>
			tears well upon sight<br>
			its just so bright<br>
			light<br>
			and #FFFervescent<br>
			so, to your original question<br>
			the first year I remember is mint green twenty fourteen<br>
			i remember a time and a place so far away,<br>
			even if you unraveled every infinity scarf<br>
			their yarn couldn’t span the cognitive distance<br>
			between now and then<br>
			i remember learning to love not to remember<br>
			i remember drowning in a sea of infinate potentiality<br>
			and waking up in a bathtub of blue light<br>
			reborn into a virtual reality<br>
			where gravity and consequences don't exist<br>
			where im as light as a feather<br>
			and a feather is as light as me<br>
			where white converse turn red<br>
			the aquamarine queen is dead<br>
			her rain is over<br>
			slain bloodstain and sober<br>
			stop saying<br>
			i want to dye<br>
			it mint green <br>
			i want to be<br>
			s o go d dam n<br>
			ce ru l e an<br>
			it burns if you stare<br>
	    too long <br>
			like medusa except <br>
			you don't turn to stone<br>
			you dissolve into flotsum<br>
			become one with the jetsum<br>
			seafoam froths forth from<br>
			your lips with delight<br>
			when the sky gapes open<br>
			fall through<br>
			fall through<br>
